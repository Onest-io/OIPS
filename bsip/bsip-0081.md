# Abstract
[BSIP67](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/issues/130) proposed a mechanism
which has maker-taker fees in consideration, but it's relatively complex.

This BSIP proposes a protocol change to enable asset owners to specify
different market fee rate for maker orders and taker orders.

# Motivation

Asset owners need tools to incentivize trading of their assets.

# Rationale

Maker-taker fee model is adopted widely in centralized exchanges and helped
them to attract trading activities.

# Specification

There is already a flag `market_fee_percent` in asset options.

Add a new optional flag `taker_fee_percent` into asset options, 
which can only be set
or updated by asset owners after the consensus upgrade.
The valid range of the new flag is `[0%, 100%]`.

Before the consensus upgrade, when an order buying that asset
got filled, the amount `bought_amount * market_fee_percent`
(capped by `max_market_fee`)
will enter the asset's market fee sharing process.

After the consensus upgrade, when an order buying the asset
got filled,
* if the order is a *maker*, or the `taker_fee_percent` flag
  is not set in the asset, the amount
  `bought_amount * market_fee_percent` 
  (capped by `max_market_fee`)
  will enter the asset's market fee sharing process;
* otherwise (if the order is a *taker* and the
  `taker_fee_percent` is set in the asset), the amount
  `bought_amount * taker_fee_percent`
  (capped by `max_market_fee`)
  will enter the asset's market fee sharing process.
